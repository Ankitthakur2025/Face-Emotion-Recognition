# Face-Emotion-Recognition
Face emotion recognition in Python uses ML and image processing to analyze facial expressions. It extracts features from facial landmarks to classify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and more.

Face emotion recognition using Python is a computer vision technique that analyzes facial expressions to identify emotions. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow, it detects key facial features, extracts relevant information, and classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise. This enables applications in various domains like human-computer interaction, market research, and mental health assessment, empowering developers to build intelligent systems that can understand and respond to human emotions in real-time.
